## Lab 2 Assignment (both .Rmd & .pdf) - Due 11:59pm, Thursday, Feburary 27, on Quercus
## Direct link to assignment - https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/380331/assignments/1436694

## Graded out of **22 marks**
## *We strongly recommend you review the R code used in LearnR Modules 1 AND 2  **before** attempting this lab assignment to familiarize yourself with R code that will be useful for this assignment.*
## Note that late assignments and assignments submitted other ways (e.g., over email) will not be accepted. Both the rmd file of your answers and the pdf file produced by knitting your rmd to pdf must be submitted. If you have trouble knitting your assignment, submit your completed Rmd on its own by the deadline so you can earn partial credit toward this assignment.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a syntax for authoring documents that are a mix of text and R code and output. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
When you click the **Knit** button above, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. When you submit lab assignments in STA288, you will need to submit this R Markdown (.Rmd) file AND the pdf file you generate by clicking on **Knit > Knit to PDF** above (save that file as STA288Lab2yourname.pdf). To save on your own machine to upload to Quercus, check the boxes next to the two files in the files tab on the right, then click **More > Export** and download to your own machine. 

*NOTE - Remember to save a copy of this rmd file as STA288Lab2yourname.rmd before you start editing it. And, be sure to knit often!*

In this lab, you will summarize, analyze and interpret some data on the mice in the study described in the following paper:

Crilly NP, Zita MD, Beaver AK, Sysa-Shah P, Bhalodia A, Gabrielson K, Adamo L, Mugnier MR. (2025). "A murine model of Trypanosoma brucei-induced myocarditis and cardiac dysfunction". Microbiol Spectr 13:e01623-24. <https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.01623-24>

The following code sets up R markdown and reads in the raw data and stores it in an R dataset called *Lab2data.* You should not need to edit this chunk of code. Be sure to run this before running the later R code so that the dataset is read in and ready for you to work with. If you do not do this, you will see error messages when you try to run chunks of R code in your rmd document.
If you get an error when trying to read in the data, please ensure that your working directory is set to the same folder the data file and .rmd file is saved in. Click on **More > Session > Set Working Directory** to choose a folder to be your working directory.

Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite that causes human and animal African trypanosomiases (HAT and AAT), a common symptom of which is cardiac disfunction.  The purpose of this study is to explore a mouse model for cardiac dysfunction in African trypanosomiasis which can be used to support further research on HAT disease and potential interventions. In this study mice were infected with T. brucei and cardiac biomarkers and function were evaluated and compared to uninfected controls.

In this lab assignment you will be working with the data the authors used to produce Figure 1C and Table 1 from Crilly et al. (2025). The code below displays information about these data. 

```{r}

All questions within this Lab Assignment must be answered using R code/output in this rmd file and the Figure 1C/Table 1 data from Crilly et al. (2025).

\newpage

## QUESTION 1 [10 marks total]

For this question, we will focus on the data for the 10 infected mice whose results are shown in Figure 1C of Crilly et al. (2025).

**a.**	*(2 marks)* What sampling method was applied by Crilly et al. (2025)? Be specific and use STA288 vocabulary, and briefly justify your answer based on what the researchers did.

*1a ANSWER*: 


An electrocardiogram (EKG) records the heart's electrical activity over repeated cardiac cycles. One of the key metrics recorded is the length of the “QRS complex”, shows the electrical activity of the heart's ventricle. For parts b-??, we will consider the `QRS Interval ms` variable from this dataset, which measures the length of the QRS complex at 28 days postinfection (dpi).

**b.** *(1 mark)* What was the average length of the QRS complexin milliseconds 28 dpi for the *10 infected mice* in the study?  

```{r}



```



**c.** *(4 marks)* Simulate the appropriate bootstrap sampling distribution and construct a *95% Percentile Bootstrap Confidence Interval* to estimate the mean length of the QRS complex based on the data on these 10 infected mice. Display your bootstrap sampling distribution and the limits of the confidence interval. 

Set the seed using your student number and be sure to include comments in your R code to describe your steps.

```{r}


```

**d.** *(2 marks)* Assuming this statistical procedure is appropriate (i.e., regardless to your answer to the next question), interpret your confidence interval from part *c* in the context of the study. 

*1d ANSWER*: 


**e.** *(1 mark)* Is the statistical procedure you conducted in *c* appropriate to estimate the average length of the QRS complex for all mice infected with Trypanosoma brucei? Briefly justify your answer.

*1e ANSWER*: 


*NOTE - Remember to save a copy of this rmd file as STA288Lab2yourname.rmd. And, be sure to knit often!*

## QUESTION 2 [12 marks total] 

In this question, we are interested in comparing the 28 dpi heart rate (measured in beats per minute and stored in variable `Heart Rate BPM`) between the infected and uninfected control mice. 

**a.**	*(2 marks)* What is the study design used in the Crilly et al. (2025) paper? Be specific and use STA288 vocabulary, and briefly justify your answer based on how the researchers conducted the study.

*2a ANSWER*: 

    
**b.** *(1 mark)* Reproduce the first plot in Figure 1C (Crilly et al. (2025)) and compare your plot to the one shown in Figure 1C. Do they match? If not, what might explain the discrepancy?

```{r}


```


**c.** *(2 marks)* Suppose we wish to compare heart rates between the infected and control groups. State the null and alternative hypotheses for the appropriate randomization test that would enable us to study this. Be sure to define any symbols you use.

*2c ANSWER*: 


**d.** *(4 marks)* Using a *1% significance level*, perform a andomization test for the difference in mean heart rates between the infected and uninfected mice 28 dpi. Simulate and display the appropriate sampling distribution and report your estimated p-value. Set the seed using your student number and be sure to include comments in your R code to describe all your steps. 

```{r}


```


**e.** *(2 marks)* Assuming this procedure is appropriate for these data (i.e., regardless of your answer to part g), write a conclusion to the hypothesis test you conducted in this question in the context of this study.

*2e ANSWER*: 


**f.** *(1 mark)* Do you trust the p-value you computed? In other words, is the statistical procedure you conducted in this question appropriate to compare mean heart rates for mice infected with Trypanosoma brucei to that for uninfected? Briefly justify your answer.

*2f ANSWER*:
